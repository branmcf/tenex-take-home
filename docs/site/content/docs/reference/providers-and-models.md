## Selecting a Model

Users can set their preferred model using the [Update Model Preference](../endpoints/backend/users/update-model-preference.md) endpoint. The selected model will be used for all chat conversations and workflow executions.

### Example: Get Available Models

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.hardwire.dev/api/models" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

### Example: Update Model Preference

```bash
curl -X PUT "https://api.hardwire.dev/api/users/model-preference" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"modelId": "claude-opus-4.5"}'
```

## Model Capabilities

All supported models provide:

- **Chat completion** - Conversational responses to user messages
- **Tool use** - Ability to invoke MCP tools during workflow execution
- **Streaming** - Real-time response streaming for both chat and workflows

## Cost Considerations

Model pricing is based on token usage:

- **Input tokens** - Charged for the text sent to the model (user messages, system prompts, context)
- **Output tokens** - Charged for the text generated by the model (assistant responses)

Choose the appropriate model based on your use case:

- **gemini-2.5-pro** - Best value for general-purpose tasks
- **gpt-5.2** - Good balance of capability and cost
- **claude-opus-4.5** - Premium model for complex reasoning tasks
